HOUSEKEEPING ORDER 002 COMPLETION REPORT
========================================

Date: 2025-09-24
Order ID: housekeeping-002
Status: COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully completed all tasks from housekeeping-002 order to finish outstanding work from housekeeping-001. The main goal was to document the repository layout and confirm references after the previous reorganization that moved demo apps to the examples/ directory.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced README.md Repository Structure Section
**File Modified:** README.md (lines 82-102)

**Changes:**
- Expanded the existing "üèóÔ∏è Repository Structure" section with detailed subdirectory descriptions
- Added missing directories: output/, docs/orders/, docs/reports/
- Enhanced src/ subdirectory descriptions (core/, extractors/, ui/, utils/, visualization/)
- Added reference to docs/orders/ for contributors to find active housekeeping orders
- Enhanced examples/ description to mention 5 demo apps
- Kept existing links to PRD and ADR documents (already correct)

### 2. Verification Completed
**Status:** All directory references and links verified as accurate
- ‚úÖ docs/pluggable_extractors_prd.md exists and is accessible
- ‚úÖ docs/adr/ADR-001-pluggable-extractors.md exists and is accessible
- ‚úÖ All described subdirectories exist and match documentation
- ‚úÖ Path references in CLAUDE.md already point correctly to examples/

## Key Findings

### What Was Already Correct:
- CLAUDE.md had proper examples/ paths for demo applications
- README.md design document links were working correctly
- No broken references or outdated command paths found

### What Was Updated:
- README Repository Structure section enhanced with comprehensive directory map

## Follow-up Items
