## Quality Assessment

### Provider Analysis

#### 1. LangExtract (Gemini 2.0 Flash) - 83 Events
**Quality Score: 6/10**

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage - captures all document details
- ✅ Identifies citations when present
- ✅ Good date extraction

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ Over-extraction - treats contract clauses as separate events
- ❌ Noisy output - many non-event provisions included
- ❌ Requires post-processing filtering

**Sample Event**:
```
Date: 2009-09-03
Event: "On September 3, 2009, in Delhi, Amrapali Eden Park Developers
Private Limited and Madhu Ranjan... entered into a Flat Buyer Agreement..."
Citation: Companies Act, 1956
```

**Use Case**: Comprehensive document analysis where completeness matters more than precision

---

#### 2. OpenRouter (GPT-4o-mini) - 4 Events
**Quality Score: 8/10** ⭐

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Balanced extraction - consolidates related clauses into logical events
- ✅ Good contextual descriptions (2-3 sentences)
- ✅ Identifies multiple citations per event
- ✅ No obvious false positives

**Weaknesses**:
- ⚠️ May miss some intermediate events due to consolidation
- ⚠️ Cost not directly tracked (estimated)

**Sample Event**:
```
Date: 2009-09-03
Event: "On September 3, 2009, a Flat Buyer Agreement was executed between
Amrapali Eden Park Developers Private Limited and the individual allottee,
Madhu Ranjan and Harish Chander, for the allotment of a residential unit..."
Citation: Companies Act, 1956; Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999;
Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934; Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
```

**Use Case**: **Production default** - Best balance for most paralegal workflows

---

#### 3. OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini) - 6 Events
**Quality Score: 8/10** ⭐

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Detailed event descriptions with full context
- ✅ Good balance between granularity and consolidation
- ✅ Clear cost tracking ($0.0301/doc)
- ✅ Consistent output format

**Weaknesses**:
- ⚠️ Higher cost than Anthropic (10x)
- ⚠️ Slower than Anthropic (4x)

**Sample Event**:
```
Date: 2009-09-03
Event: "On September 3, 2009, a Flat Buyer Agreement was executed between
Amrapali Eden Park Developers Private Limited (the Developer) and individual
purchasers, including Madhu Ranjan and Harish Chander (the Allottees)..."
Citation: (none provided)
```

**Use Case**: **High-stakes legal work** - When quality and detail matter most

---

#### 4. Anthropic (Claude 3 Haiku) - 2 Events
**Quality Score: 7/10**

**Strengths**:
- ✅✅ **Fastest** (4.4s) and **cheapest** ($0.0032)
- ✅✅ Highest precision - only true discrete legal events
- ✅✅ **Unique**: Found actual citation "Lease Deed dated 17.03.2009" that others missed
- ✅ Clean, focused output

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ Low recall - may miss intermediate events
- ❌ Very conservative extraction (only 2 events from 15-page contract)

**Sample Event**:
```
Date: 17.03.2009
Event: "The Developer, Amrapali Eden Park Developers Private Limited,
acquired the right, title and interest in Group Housing Plot bearing
No. F-27 admeasuring 11,925.67 square meters, Sector 50, Noida..."
Citation: Lease Deed dated 17.03.2009
```

**Use Case**: **High-volume processing** - Fast, cheap, precise for large-scale extraction

---

#### 5. OpenCode Zen - FAILED
**Quality Score: 0/10**

**Status**: ❌ Connection error
**Error**: `('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response'))`

**Assessment**: Not production-ready, unstable API

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Extraction Strategy Variance

Providers interpret "legal event" differently:

| Strategy | Providers | Event Count | Approach |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Granular** | LangExtract | 83 | Each clause = separate event |
| **Consolidated** | OpenRouter, OpenAI | 4-6 | Logical grouping of related clauses |
| **Minimal** | Anthropic | 2 | Only primary contractual milestones |

**Implication**: Event count alone is not a quality metric. Context and use case determine the optimal strategy.

### 2. Speed vs Quality Tradeoff

- **Anthropic** achieves 4x speed advantage but extracts only 2 events
- **LangExtract** is slowest but most comprehensive
- **OpenRouter/OpenAI** balance speed, cost, and completeness

### 3. Cost Efficiency

- **Anthropic**: $0.0032 (cheapest, 10x less than OpenAI)
- **OpenRouter**: ~$0.015 (estimated, good value)
- **OpenAI**: $0.0301 (most expensive, but detailed)

**ROI Analysis**: For 1000 documents:
- Anthropic: $3.20
- OpenRouter: ~$15
- OpenAI: $30.10

### 4. Unique Capabilities

- **Anthropic**: Only provider to find actual citation reference ("Lease Deed dated 17.03.2009")
- **OpenRouter**: Best at identifying multiple citations per event
- **OpenAI**: Most detailed event descriptions
