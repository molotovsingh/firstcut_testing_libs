### REVISION-2025-10-02.md
**Status**: Completed
**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Purpose**: Revised implementation plan prioritizing value-first delivery (providers before infrastructure)

**Key Changes**:
- Reordered phases from waterfall (Config→Parsers→Providers) to value-first (Providers→Manual Test→Automation)
- Reduced timeline from 9 weeks to 4-5 weeks for provider implementation
- Deferred parser abstraction until second parser needed

**Outcome**:
- ✅ Phase 1 (Providers): 6/8 implemented (75% complete as of 2025-10-04)
- ✅ Phase 2 (Manual Eval): Complete (OpenRouter/OpenAI/Anthropic evaluated)
- ✅ Phase 3 (Benchmark Configs): Complete (3 test sets created)
- ✅ Phase 4 (Automation): Complete with 3-judge panel system
- ⏸️ Phase 5 (Parser Abstraction): Deferred (no 2nd parser yet)

**Archived Reason**: Plan successfully executed. Current provider status (6/8) documented in active docs.

### parser-extractor-matrix-research-plan.md
**Status**: Completed
**Date**: 2025-09-24 (original), updated through 2025-10-02
**Purpose**: Comprehensive research plan for testing parser-extractor combinations

**Key Sections**:
- Provider authentication matrix (lines 204-213)
- Implementation phases (5 phases)
- Success criteria and testing framework

**Outdated Information**:
- Lines 209-211 show OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek as "⏳ Planned"
- **Reality**: All 3 are ✅ Implemented as of 2025-10-02 (OpenAI), 2025-10-02 (Anthropic), 2025-10-04 (DeepSeek)

**Archived Reason**: Planning complete. All 6 providers (LangExtract, OpenRouter, OpenCode Zen, OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek) are now documented in current architecture docs (ADR-001, configuration.md, README.md).
